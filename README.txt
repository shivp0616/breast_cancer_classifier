Machine learning models to classify data-set into different types of breast cancer. The software used is Matlab.
Different classifiers are used to classify the the data and the performance of each classifiers can be checked using confusion matrix.

The breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin
   Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.
